Task ID: 1-read
Agent: optimizer-streams
Task: Clone repo, read ROADMAP/PROGRESS/RULES/TASKS + research + train_qwen.py to gather context before Wave 1.

Work Log:
- Cloned branch `agent/optimizer-streams` from `pkhairkh/qwen-palettize.git`.
- Read `agent-ctx/ROADMAP.md` (4-agent coordination plan, line-range ownership).
- Read `agent-ctx/PROGRESS.md` (all agents Pending, no merges yet).
- Read `agent-ctx/agent-optimizer-streams/RULES.md` + `TASKS.md` (Patch 8 = build_optimizers ~540-600, Patch 6 = training loop ~1058-1103).
- Read research docs: `03_optimizer_speedup.md` (Patch 8 reference, Option B = bitsandbytes AdamW8bit), `02_kernel_efficiency.md` (Patch 6 reference), `06_stream_overlap.md` (full double-buffer design), `08_recommendations.md` (priority roadmap).
- Verified inbox (`agent-optimizer-streams/inbox/`) is empty — no RELEASED message from nn-module-foundation. Wave 1 can start in parallel.
- Read `train_qwen.py`: `build_optimizers()` at lines 552-611 (line 597 = the `FP32MasterAdamW` to replace), scheduler init at lines 973-975 (line 975 = `opt_indices.opt` to drop), training loop at lines 1031-1210 (teacher-forward at 1058-1078, student-fwd at 1082-1099, loss at 1103).

Stage Summary:
- Wave 1 prerequisites satisfied. Wave 1 touches lines 540-600 (my exclusive territory).
- No `RELEASED` message in inbox — will NOT rebase before Wave 2 (Wave 2 may need rebase after nn-module-foundation merges).
- Key change sites identified:
  - `requirements.txt` (does NOT exist — will create new file).
  - Line 597: `opt_indices = FP32MasterAdamW(...)` → `bnb.optim.AdamW8bit(...)`.
  - Line 975: `sched_indices = LambdaLR(opt_indices.opt, ...)` → `LambdaLR(opt_indices, ...)`.
  - `update_lrs()` (lines 643-650) uses `opt_indices.param_groups` which works for both wrapper and direct optimizer — no change required.
  - Training loop (1058-1103) to be restructured in Wave 2 with double-buffered h_out_buf + events.

Task ID: 2-wave1
Agent: optimizer-streams
Task: Wave 1 — Patch 8 (fused AdamW via bitsandbytes 8-bit). DoD: replace FP32MasterAdamW with bnb.optim.AdamW8bit, fix scheduler init, update_lrs compatible, syntax check, push.

Work Log:
- Sub-task 8a: created requirements.txt with bitsandbytes>=0.43.0 + rationale comment block. Commit cd50c41.
- Sub-task 8b: replaced `FP32MasterAdamW(plain_adamw_groups, betas=(0.9, 0.95), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0.0)` at line 597 with `bnb.optim.AdamW8bit(...)` + explanatory comment. Syntax check OK. Commit 6decbbd.
- Sub-task 8c: at line 982, dropped `.opt` indirection from `LambdaLR(opt_indices.opt, lr_lambda)` → `LambdaLR(opt_indices, lr_lambda)`. Left `opt_muon.opt` and `opt_adamw.opt` alone (still FP32Master* wrappers). Confirmed `update_lrs()` (lines 643-650) needs no change — uses `opt_indices.param_groups` which works for both wrapper (@property → .opt.param_groups) and direct optimizer (native attribute). Syntax check OK. Commit 8c72021.
- Pushed all 3 commits + Wave 1 status commit (d1692c1) to origin/agent/optimizer-streams.
- Updated agent-ctx/PROGRESS.md: optimizer-streams Wave 1 ✅, Patch 8 ✅ (commit 8c72021), event log entry added.

Stage Summary:
- Wave 1 DoD fully met. Branch pushed: agent/optimizer-streams @ d1692c1.
- No NaN observed yet (offline — no training server). Wave 3 will verify with eps=1e-6 fallback ready.
- No `RELEASED` message yet from nn-module-foundation in my inbox — but nn-module changes (Patch 9) are not a hard dependency for Wave 2 (Patch 6 only touches training loop lines 1058-1103, which I own). I will check inbox at start of Wave 2 and rebase if `RELEASED` arrived; otherwise proceed without rebase.

Task ID: 3-wave2
Agent: optimizer-streams
Task: Wave 2 — Patch 6 (stream double-buffering). DoD: persistent stream_t, h_out_buf[2], event_t[2]+event_s[2], teacher fwd overlaps with student bwd, syntax check, push, inbox messages.

Work Log:
- Sub-task 6a: checked inbox — empty (no RELEASED from nn-module-foundation). Decided to proceed with Wave 2 anyway since Patch 6 only touches my exclusive territory (training loop lines 1058-1103, now 1067-1112 after Wave 1) — nn.Module refactor is not a hard prerequisite. Sent LOCK message to training-recipe inbox (timestamp 1787399068). Commit e778f56.
- Sub-task 6b: inserted pre-loop allocation block (lines 1040-1060) with stream_t, h_out_buf[2], event_t[2], event_s[2], buf_idx=0 + invariants comment. Changed `for batch_ids in data_stream:` to `for step, batch_ids in enumerate(data_stream):`. Restructured teacher forward to write to h_out_buf[buf_idx] via .copy_() for buffer reuse. Added `if step > 0: stream_t.wait_event(event_s[buf_idx])` at iter start. Added `event_t[buf_idx].record(stream_t)` after teacher forward. Added `current_stream().wait_event(event_t[buf_idx])` before student forward. Changed loss computation to use `h_out_buf[buf_idx]` + `h_out = h_out_buf[buf_idx]` alias for downstream references. Added `event_s[buf_idx].record(current_stream())` IMMEDIATELY after compute_loss (BEFORE backward) — invariant 4 from research doc 06 §3.1. Added `buf_idx = 1 - buf_idx` ping-pong on both NaN-skip path (line 1176) and end-of-iter (line 1267). Syntax check OK. Commit a2576f5.
- Verified: `t = teacher_out.detach().float()` in `compute_loss` creates a new fp32 tensor (bf16→fp32 dtype cast always copies storage). So once `compute_loss` returns, the bf16 `h_out_buf[buf_idx]` is no longer needed by autograd — recording `event_s` immediately is safe (the saved `t` is independent).
- Verified: `del h_out, ...` in NaN skip path and end-of-iter only removes the local alias binding; the underlying tensor in `h_out_buf[buf_idx]` is still alive (held by the list) and will be reused by `.copy_()` next ping-pong cycle.
- Patch 3 territory (training-recipe): the `par.data.clamp_(-20.0, 20.0)` at line 1209 was NOT touched. τ annealing (1065-1071) and JSON hyperparams check (1073-1087) also untouched.
- Sub-task 6c: sent RELEASED message to training-recipe inbox (timestamp 1787399191). Updated PROGRESS.md: Patch 6 ✅ (commit a2576f5), Wave 2 ✅, event log entries added, inbox summary updated. Commit 8254bf1.
- Pushed all 4 commits (e778f56 + a2576f5 + 8254bf1) to origin/agent/optimizer-streams.

Stage Summary:
- Wave 2 DoD fully met. Branch pushed: agent/optimizer-streams @ 8254bf1.
- Branch is NOT rebased on origin/main (no new commits to main since clone; no nn.Module changes to pull).
- Wave 3 will: (9a) verify no NaN with 8-bit AdamW + eps fallback ready, (9b) merge origin/main (no conflicts expected since main hasn't moved), (9c) final PROGRESS update.
